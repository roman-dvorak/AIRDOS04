# AIRDOS04 - Specialized Cosmic Radiation Dosimeter for Airliners

![AIRDOS04](doc/img/AIRDOS04.jpg)

The upgraded version of [AIRDOS02](https://github.com/UniversalScientificTechnologies/AIRDOS02) airborne detector. The instrument is designed primarily for the dosimetry of cabin crew and flight attendants of commercial flights. A detailed description of the use is in the [user manual](https://docs.dos.ust.cz/airdos/AIRDOS04).

## Design features 

  - Rechargeable accumulators integrated with data storage in the hot-swap module called [BATDATUNIT01](https://docs.dos.ust.cz/airdos/BATDATUNIT01)
    - The changeable module allows new possible features in the future like GNSS-based position logging with a revised module 
  - One month of continuous logging for a single accumulator charge
  - Easy activation by insertion of BATDATUNIT module into the device
  - Data download without special software (Mass storage media)
  - Continuously incrementing time marks (Unique logging time from every measurement) 

## Where to get it?

AIRDOS04 is commercially available from [Universal Scientific Technologies s.r.o.](https://www.ust.cz/), write an email to sale@ust.cz.
The device is designed as open-source hardware and software and is released under the GPLv3 license. The device was initially developed and maintained by [UST (Universal Scientific Technologies s.r.o.)](https://www.ust.cz) company, which sells it commercially and offers technical support.
